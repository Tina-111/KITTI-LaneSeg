# Description
A course project for ECE 470: Artificial Intelligence for lane detection using a CNN

## Getting Started
All files are available on a personal [OneDrive link](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AnSUzPfRDFUagcFB0qdPnt9YKApvcw?e=Drg1qf). Instructions to download from source are below.

The KITTI road dataset should be unzipped and placed in a subdirectory called data, so the final path to the images is

### Downloading dataset from source
Download the KITTI road dataset base kit from the [KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite website](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php). 

### Download pre-trained model files
TODO find source link for ImageNet trained ResNet weights

# Requirements
Download ResNet V2 50 and VGG 16 from [Tensorflow's GitHub link](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim#pre-trained-models)

# TODO
- link to ResNet18, 50 initial training weights
- link to model
- link to trained outputs
- proper set up of repo to train/test
